expex-demo.tex

This file contains most of the examples in the documentation.  It is
intended to facilitate user experimentation with ExPex typesetting.
Users can easily modify examples and see what the effect is. It can be
run under either Plain Tex or LaTex.  Except for expex.tex and
expex.sty, all files needed to run expex-demo should be part of any
Tex installation.

Changes (from Version 5.0):

1. In earlier versions before 5.0, {} empty items on the gla line were
possible.  In 5.0, {{}} was required.  This version restores the old
behavior.

2. In versions before 5.0, glosses were built in a vbox, hence could
not split between pages.  5.0 made glosses breakable, provided no
explicit width was specified.  5.0 restores the old behavior but
introduces a parameter <glossbreaking>.  It is set to false in
expex.tex so that the default behavior is the old behavior.  But it
can be set to true if the user wants glosses to break between pages.
